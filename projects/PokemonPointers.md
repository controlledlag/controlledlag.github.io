summary: Me and my team build a pokemon game using pointers

  Coming from a new experienced world of java and object orientated programing I was in second ICS class where I learned C/C++. This gave me a whole perspective on coding because I was able to learn about functional coding but ever more importantly pointers. The one major thing that helped me to understand pointers better was a group project that I did for this class. The group project that we had to do was to build a Pok√©mon game.
  
   Understanding how to build the structure of the game was not too bad thanks to my experience and knowledge from learning java. The hard part about this project was using pointers appropriately and understanding how to trouble shoot pointers. With pointers you could either have an address or a value to the thing that you are pointing at. I was not able to fully get how to use them effectively until one of my team members helped me to understand how they work. I feel like because of this I was able to become a better coder because all languages have pointers. Understanding this aspect helps me to see things in a different point view.
