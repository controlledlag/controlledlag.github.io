 The first time I took an ICS class I learned Java like most people. The thing is when I took this ICS class, I had no prior knowledge or experience with programming. I went into this class as blind as a bat and till this day it has been one of my most memorable class.  Me and my team had to make a game for our final project, and we decided to make a generic tower defense game. 
 
This was probably one of the hardest and most challenging project I had to work on. I had just learned about how to do object orientated programing and although we were thought what to do I was not one hundred percent caught up. I was still lagging in some of the concepts like recursion, parent/child classes, and function metamorphosis to name a few. I had to see a tutor and study a lot just to understand what was going on in my project. Also, I had to meet up with my group mates a lot to make sure everyone was on the same page. Sadly, during this time none of us thought to use GitHub so it is safe to say we made life ten times harder. Although I made a lot of mistakes during this project the amount of growth I received was well deserved.
