  When I was in my first ICS class we learned about java. This was the first programing language I had ever came across. I was truly overwhelmed and fascinated about what coding really is. Up until this point, I had no prior experience with coding. I had a project where I would work with a team, and we had to come up with a functioning game. We decide to build a tower defense game.

  This was a challenge for me because we had to combine all the knowledge we learned from this course into a single project. At this point I wasnâ€™t grasping the idea of object orientated programing just yet. I had trouble with understanding how each function and class corresponded to an object and how the object were combined to make a running game. After a lot of trial and errors and collaborative discussions with my teammates it finally clicked. I was finally able to understand how all these interworking parts were connected.
