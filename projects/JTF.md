	In 2020 when covid started to affect Hawaii I was called to be apart of the Joint Task Force to combat covid. The Joint Task Force is a combination of the Army national guard and Air Force national guard. My team was tasked finding out how to keep essential personnel, health care worker, military members safe while wearing proper personnel protective equipment PPE for short. We went around the state and to different organizations educating and training their personnel on how use and stay safe in their PPE to do their jobs while fighting with COVID. 
	Since I was one of the people who started this program, I learned a lot of valuable skills and gained a lot of valuable experiences. Having to manage a team to handle both civilian and military people taught me how to be a good leader, coordinator, and planner. Also the people skills I have developed from this line of work would help me out when having to work with other people in a group setting.
