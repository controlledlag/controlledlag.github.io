  Recursion has always been a difficult thing for me. Not sure what it is but I have never been good at making or understanding a lot of recursive functions. I learned about it in my first ICS class but didnâ€™t really understand it. It was not until my second ICS class where it started to make sense to me. This was crucial and impactful to me because without this I would not have been able to get better with data structures and algorithms which is a crucial skill to have as a programmer. 
  
  Trying to understand recursion I have traced every recursion function I could. I would go into an excel document and track every variable and every line in a recursion function to understand what is going on. Eventually I was able to understand it, but it was not until a long and gruesome time of working through countless recursive problems. Finally being able to understand recursion gave me a better insight on how to structure code and flow of code works.
