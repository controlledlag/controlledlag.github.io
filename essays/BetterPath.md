## Video Game Wisdom  
I recently have gotten into an exceedingly popular shooter game called Valorant. In this game, there are two teams, a defender side and an attacker side. The goal for the defenders is to prevent the attacker from planting and detonating a bomb. The goal for the attackers is to plant the bomb within a given time frame. I see design patterns in a comparable way to the strategies used in this game. There are general strategies in this game that are used both for defenders and attackers that are common knowledge. These strategies are what everyone uses to try to secure a victory for their team. However, there are an infinite number of strategies that can be used at any given moment and variations of popular strategies. This is similar to how design patterns have a set amount of common solutions to a problems but very differently given the type of problem. In Valorant no two matches are the same regardless of how many common factors each team may share. Each team will have their variation of a strategy or design pattern even though the goals are the same for every match.  

  
## POV’s of “Da Rainbow” 
One of the design patterns that I believe that I have been unknowingly using is the Model-View-Controller. Since this class that I am currently taking is a web-based software engineering class it would be weird not to be implementing the Model-View-Controller method. The project that my teammates and I are working on is called “Over Da Rainbow” and is a good showcase of the method at work. This project is a website that uses MongoDb, Semantic UI, Meteor, and React. The model would be the server-side component which would be Meteor and MongoDB among other things. The view component would be the client-side component which has the html and CSS coding. The controller would be like the jsx where you are trying to manage the data between what the user is seeing and the data from the server.  

 ## The Winning Strategy 
Design patterns are what we as a collective of people produced to efficiently solve reoccurring problems. The conceptual idea of it is something that I believe could be applied to a lot of other things. For example, the gaming example I gave showed how design patterns could be used for playing video games. Sometimes people use it without even knowing what it is like I did with my group project, that is how instrumental the concept of design patterns is to not only coding but everyday life.
