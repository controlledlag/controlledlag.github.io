Coding standards are an invaluable technique to have if you are pursuing software engineering as a career. I am fairly new when it comes to java script and eslint so my experience with them is short. While learning about coding standards I found it to be frustrating and challenging. It was challenging because java script was not my first coding language. So, I have decent amount of time that I have spent coding in other languages. This led to some of the habits that I have acquired during my time of coding. As a lot of people may know changing a habit is hard and this is where the challenging aspect of it comes in. 

It was also very frustrating since I am still in the process of changing my habits to match coding standards. Eslint is a nice code checker because it does notify you of errors as well as bad code structure and coding choices. The downside to this compared to others is that it is a little slow when scanning your code. This must be my biggest issue with it. Other than that, it is nice to see that little green check mark in the corner notifying me that my code is written properly and that there may not be errors.

I do think that the trouble that coding standards gives you in the beginning is worth it. It is there to make you a better coder and to make reading your code easier. It makes you really think about what you are writing and why you are writing it. For example I used to use ‘let’ a lot when ever I wrote my programs. Eslint reminds that sometimes a ‘const’ would be better if I do not plan on updating this value. It is little things like this that helped me gain a deeper understanding of what I am writing and how I want to shape my code.
