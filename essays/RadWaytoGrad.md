This has been my first experience with Rad Grad and I have to say it was pretty interesting. To me Rad Grad was like a more upgraded version of star but with tools that help prepare you for life after college. I thought that aspect of it was useful. Yes we have opportunities in school to help better our selves but itâ€™s not always easy to find those opportunities.
