This has been my first experience with Rad Grad and I have to say it was pretty interesting. To me Rad Grad was like a more upgraded version of star but with tools that help prepare you for life after college. I thought that aspect of it was useful. Yes, we have opportunities in school to help better our selves but itâ€™s not always easy to find those opportunities. With Rad Grad you are able to find opportunities based on your major which is helps cut down the time and stress in trying to find opportunities. 

Not only can you find opportunities based on your major but you can even get into specifics of what your interest are. This to me is a game changer because it utilizes the benefits of tags to help specify the results you get to your own self. All in all I think Rad Grad is something everyone should try and use at least once so they can experience a user friendly way of bettering their lives.
