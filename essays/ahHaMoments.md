## Introduction
Semantics UI is definitely not something people can generally pick up and master right away. Semantics UI is kind of like learning kanji in Japanese. You would need to know how to write Japanese to write      kanji. Kanji uses the Japanese characters to create new words through how the kanji is written and the context of how it is used. The kanji then helps to abbreviate the work of the sentence or enhance it. Semantics UI is also like the underscore function in Java Script but in this case it’s more helpful than kanji is often than not. The ability to utilize Semantics UI is a frustrating journey but well rewarded.

## Bumpy Roads and Hair Lost
With no exaggeration Semantics UI is a frustrating thing to get used to, especially if it is your first-time learning web-based programing languages. One thing that made it difficult for me to learn Semantics UI was not knowing what the tools I had were. Semantics UI has a plethora of useful, simple, and time saving tools. Figuring out what tools you have for the first time is stressful. Like for example there were some characteristics like “fluid” that was almost in no example, I did not know it could be used with almost any class. Another thing that was frustrating about Semantics UI not knowing how to use the different tool properly. Yes, you would get examples of how to name class’s like “class=”ui container”” but there is not a clear structure on how much and it what way you can combine them or divide them. Since we do not know how the Semantics UI tools are made it makes it harder to understand what is going on beneath just calling the class.

## The Ah Ha Moments
Hard paths usually lead to a better destination. There were a few “ah ha!” moments that have happened to me on my journey of understanding Semantics UI. The first time I figured out how to use Semantics UI to structure a web page it felt vastly rewarding. Know looking at a web page I see it in sections and divs. Mentally I break it down with tools from Semantics UI. This helped me look at websites in a more efficient and alternative way. Another great thing that I learned from Semantics UI was being able to combine different class attributes in different ways. Instead of having one long class sometimes it might be better to break that class down into different divs. For example, we could have a “class=”ui four column grid container”” but it might be better to have an overarching ui container and the column grid nested inside that container. These “ah ha!” moments are one of the many rewards that makes the troubles of coding worth it. 

## Conclusion
I personally think that Semantics UI is something you should learn if you are going into the path of web-development. The initial process is frustrating especially to me having only recently learning about web-based languages. Once you slowly start to understand how it works and have does “ah ha!” moments I feel like that’s when you start to appreciate it more. After learning how to use apply Semantics UI  it is hard to go back to just HTML and CSS.  Semantics UI is without a doubt a tiresome skill to acquire but it is more helpful than harm in the long run.
