  Software engineering is a very broad subject. For me personally I cannot definitively say exactly what my main focus would be in this general field. I have too much in mind to just choose one. My degree is in security science but I have interest in things other than just security. For example one thing that has caught my interest lately is the cloud.
  
  When I first heard about the cloud I instantly new this would be a critical thing to understand. It is easy to see that now especially when a lot of companies now a days are relying on the cloud for there software needs. Iâ€™m hoping to learn one of the two major cloud computing styles from Microsoft and Amazon. Preferable Microsoft so I could be more marketable for DOD occupations. I want to be able to set up applications and websites from the cloud and be able to trouble shoot frequent basic issues.
  
  Security on the internet plays such an importance in our everyday lives regardless if we ware software engineers or not. I have always been fascinated by the security side of coding. There is an IT side to this coin and also a coding side. For me I want to learn about them both. I feel that understanding them both would help to have a deeper understanding about how to be safe when connected to the internet. From the It perspective I want to learn what are the vulnerabilities that a computer has and understand how to protect it from potential threats. From the coding side I just want to be more skilled in being able to keep my code safe from being corrupted and blocking any potential glitches that could be exploited.
  
  One thing that is huge in the world of online security is block chain. I have a basic understand of what this is but I want to learn more about it. Block chain is used as the main security and structure for crypto current and will likely be the future of online security. I hope in the near future I am able to learn how to make my own secure block chain and be able to apply to any program I have.
