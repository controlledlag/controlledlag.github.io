  I am what you may call a late bloomer. I did not fin my passion for computer science until I was well on my way in college. Since then, it has been a rollercoaster of a journey trying to get my computer science degree. The first language that I learned was Java and from there C & C++. Before taking ICS 314 I had no prior knowledge of Java Script or front end/ web development. The more I learn about Java Script the more fascinating and intriguing it becomes. 

  Personally, I think that Java Script is an incredible language. I am just left stumped wondering why I did not learn this language in the first place. Java Script feels like you are driving a sports car on an open road with the amount of flexibility and freedom that you have with it. Yes, it does seem a little overwhelming at first but the more you ease into it the more enjoyable it becomes. Unlike with Java/C++ where in contrast it feels like you are riding a train. There is a strict structure and path you need to follow. Both are great in their own ways but, I feel like I am seeing coding in a whole new light thanks to Java Script. 
  
  Another thing that feels instrumental to exploring this new world of Java Script are the Brandon WOD’s (Work Out of the Day) in my ICS314 class. These WOD’s that are provided to us by our TA(Teachers Assistant) are as every bit crucial and impactful as an actual class in my opinion. These WOD’s are not mandatory but the amount of growth it provides you is remarkable. He goes over problems that help challenge our understanding of certain topics. Not only do we get to go through the answer step by step, but we also get to see our classmates answer and how they arrived there. This is so impactful because as a coder it’s easy to get tunnel vision. When you are able to see multiple solutions and train of thoughts to a problem it just makes you a better coder by expanding problem solving abilities.
