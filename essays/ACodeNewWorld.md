  The interest I have for computer science didn’t start until after my second year in college.
Although I’ve been around computers for a bit the world of coding was something new and intriguing to 
me. Coming from the mind set of java, C, and C++ style of coding and not having any prior experience 
with java script. As I learned more about it I was surprised how java script really set’s itself apart from
the norms of coding languages. 

  Personally, I think java script is an incredible language and I’m just asking myself why I haven’t
learned this sooner. Java script allows so much freedom and leeway when coding. For example, you
don’t have to specify your variables while making them which may sound like something insignificant  
but it is actually a huge deal. This helps me to write down the code quicker and allows for editing and  
compiling code to be a lot easier. Also, when you start to edit the code as we all end up doing this allows 
trouble shooting to go by more efficiently due to the fact that you will run into less data mismatch errors
and those alike. I feel like the way I look at coding as a whole and how to approach coding problems gets   
better the more, I interact with java script.  
  
  Another thing that helps me to see things in a different point of view are the WODs (Work Out
of the Day) from my ICS314 class. These exercises are done in java script and we are given a time limit to 
complete them. This helps me to think about problems under pressure and try to come up with a  
working solution the fastest way I can. This sometimes leads me to thinking about solutions in a way  
that I normal don’t. Since java script allows me to formulate the ideas in my head into codes quick it 
allows me to stay in this zone where I am in a coding state. Overall, I really like java script and the way I 
code in it. I can’t wait to learn more about and use it more in the future. 

  I am what you may call a late bloomer. I did not fin my passion for computer science until I was well on my way in college. Since then, it has been a rollercoaster of a journey trying to get my computer science degree. The first language that I learned was Java and from there C & C++. Before taking ICS 314 I had no prior knowledge of Java Script or front end/ web development. The more I learn about Java Script the more fascinating and intriguing it becomes. 

  Personally, I think that Java Script is an incredible language. I am just left stumped wondering why I did not learn this language in the first place. Java Script feels like you are driving a sports car on an open road with the amount of flexibility and freedom that you have with it. Yes, it does seem a little overwhelming at first but the more you ease into it the more enjoyable it becomes. Unlike with Java/C++ where in contrast it feels like you are riding a train. There is a strict structure and path you need to follow. Both are great in their own ways but, I feel like I am seeing coding in a whole new light thanks to Java Script. 
  
  Another thing that feels instrumental to exploring this new world of Java Script are the Brandon WOD’s (Work Out of the Day) in my ICS314 class. These WOD’s that are provided to us by our TA(Teachers Assistant) are as every bit crucial and impactful as an actual class in my opinion. These WOD’s are not mandatory but the amount of growth it provides you is remarkable. He goes over problems that help challenge our understanding of certain topics. Not only do we get to go through the answer step by step, but we also get to see our classmates answer and how they arrived there. This is so impactful because as a coder it’s easy to get tunnel vision. When you are able to see multiple solutions and train of thoughts to a problem it just makes you a better coder by expanding problem solving abilities.
