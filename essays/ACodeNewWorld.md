  The interest I have for computer science didn’t start until after my second year in college.
Although I’ve been around computers for a bit the world of coding was something new and intriguing to 
me. Coming from the mind set of java, C, and C++ style of coding and not having any prior experience 
with java script. As I learned more about it I was surprised how java script really set’s itself apart from
the norms of coding languages. 

  Personally, I think java script is an incredible language and I’m just asking myself why I haven’t
learned this sooner. Java script allows so much freedom and leeway when coding. For example, you
don’t have to specify your variables while making them which may sound like something insignificant  
but it is actually a huge deal. This helps me to write down the code quicker and allows for editing and  
compiling code to be a lot easier. Also, when you start to edit the code as we all end up doing this allows 
trouble shooting to go by more efficiently due to the fact that you will run into less data mismatch errors
and those alike. I feel like the way I look at coding as a whole and how to approach coding problems gets   
better the more, I interact with java script.  
  
  Another thing that helps me to see things in a different point of view are the WODs (Work Out
of the Day) from my ICS314 class. These exercises are done in java script and we are given a time limit to 
complete them. This helps me to think about problems under pressure and try to come up with a  
working solution the fastest way I can. This sometimes leads me to thinking about solutions in a way  
that I normal don’t. Since java script allows me to formulate the ideas in my head into codes quick it 
allows me to stay in this zone where I am in a coding state. Overall, I really like java script and the way I 
code in it. I can’t wait to learn more about and use it more in the future.
