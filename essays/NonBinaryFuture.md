###Introduction
Software engineering or coding is amazing. There is so much horizontal mobility in this career field that I find it hard to get bored of anything related to coding. There are so much different paths you could go down with coding but for me the three that I am interested in now are cloud computing, security science, app/ project development. Coding may be black and white in terms of your program running or not but, there are an infinite amount of things that you can code. That to me is what makes it so attractive and rewarding. 
###Cloud Computing
	One of my most recent interest is in cloud computing. They say cloud computing is the future for coding and that in the future almost everything is going to be running from the cloud. Seeing how much things are already in the cloud it is hard to go against this train of thought. I hope to learn how to manage servers through the cloud and develop skills that help open more options for me as a programmer. The kind of options I want is to have more freedom with my programs and not being restricted to certain bounds that cloud computing could alleviate. 
###Security Science
	As technology grows and becomes a more integral part of our everyday life I feel that having a good understanding of security when it comes to computer is absolutely paramount. Whenever you go to do something dangerous, new, or risky the first thing people always talk about is safety. When it comes to coding and computers, I believe it should be no different. Especially as a programmer having section in your code where you could be vulnerable to potential security breaches is something you want to avoid at all costs. That is I want to learn more about how to write safe code and also understanding what are the potential vulnerabilities so I  can avoid them and protect myself in the future.
###App Development 
	App development is such a huge field in that you can literally come up with a program about pretty much anything in this world and it is only limited by your imagination. This is what gets to me about app development is that you can create anything you want with almost unlimited freedom to it and creativity. In my opinion the only way to get  better at create programs it to create a lot of programs. To achieve a high skill level I feel I have to practice coding a lot in order to get better. Another thing is I like to work on projects with other people, so I am hoping to improve my skills on being cooperative and efficient with future group mates.
